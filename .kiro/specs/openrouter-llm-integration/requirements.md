# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate OpenRouter LLMs into the Next.js application to provide AI-powered chat functionality. OpenRouter provides access to multiple LLM providers through a unified API, allowing users to interact with various AI models through a chat interface. The integration will leverage the existing AI SDK modules (@ai-sdk/react, @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider, and ai) to create a seamless chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to an AI assistant and receive responses, so that I can have interactive conversations with different LLM models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message in the chat interface THEN the system SHALL send the message to the OpenRouter API
2. WHEN the OpenRouter API responds THEN the system SHALL display the AI response in the chat interface
3. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator until the response is received
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different AI models from OpenRouter, so that I can experience different AI capabilities and response styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a model selector with available OpenRouter models
2. WHEN a user selects a different model THEN the system SHALL use that model for subsequent conversations
3. WHEN a model is selected THEN the system SHALL persist the selection for the current session
4. IF a selected model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to a default model and notify the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OpenRouter API key to be securely configured, so that the application can authenticate with OpenRouter services without exposing sensitive credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the OpenRouter API key from environment variables
2. IF the API key is missing THEN the system SHALL display a configuration error message
3. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
4. WHEN the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my conversation history, so that I can reference previous messages and maintain context in my conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends or receives messages THEN the system SHALL store them in the conversation history
2. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL display the conversation history in chronological order
3. WHEN a new conversation starts THEN the system SHALL provide an option to clear the conversation history
4. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain the conversation history for the current session

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support proper focus management and keyboard shortcuts
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements
4. WHEN messages are long THEN the system SHALL handle text wrapping and scrolling appropriately
